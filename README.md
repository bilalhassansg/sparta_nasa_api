## Lookup
### I have been asked to test the lookup page from the nasa URL provided: https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS.
### I have first tested that the links:self returns a string. It works. I have done this by calling the method from the lookup.rb page from the global variable @nasa_lookup which has allowed it to work.
### The next test was to make sure the neo_id equals 3542519. It works. Again, I have used the method from the lookup.rb page and used the global variable @nasa_lookup. I have used different methods for different tests in the lookup.rb oage and called them in the _spec files to get the tests to execute.
